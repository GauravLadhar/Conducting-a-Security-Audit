# Botium Toys: Conducting a Security Audit

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive security audit for Botium Toys, focusing on assessing and enhancing their overall security posture. The auditâ€™s scope included evaluating critical assets such as employee devices, the internal network, and systems. I reviewed the existing security controls and compliance practices, examining policies around least privilege, disaster recovery, password management, firewalls, and more.

Through a thorough controls checklist, I identified key areas needing improvement, such as implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS), enhancing data encryption, and adopting GDPR and PCI DSS compliance measures for customer data protection. Based on my findings, I provided actionable recommendations to mitigate risks and strengthen security protocols across Botium Toys' infrastructure.

Provided with the Botium toys scope, goals, and risk assessment report, I reviewed the entire security program at the company and completed the controls and compliance checklist to determine the best practices Botium toys should employ moving forward.
